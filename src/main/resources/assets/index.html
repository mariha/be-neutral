    <p style="color: grey;">TODO: Broader context: explain why a house? Structure of personal emission.</p>
    <p>Worldwide, ongoing use of buildings account for 14% of greenhouse gas emissions: 6% is being produced on-site [1] by burning fuels at
        homes, primarily to heat space or water or for cooking; and 8% is emitted off-site [2], as a result of their electricity usage. As
        much as 80% of energy consumed is wasted [3]. </p>
    <p>For an individual, for example in Poland, house heating alone accounts for 45% (?) of their personal carbon footprint.</p>
    <p>On the right: breakdown of carbon footprint for an average person in the US [4].</p>

    <h2>How does BeNeutral work?</h2>
    <p>We calculate CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by your house, advise how to reduce it, and encourage to offset the rest by planting trees.<br/>
        In short, we help you achieve and maintain environmental-neutrality.</p>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li class="step">
            <img src="images/schema-house.png" alt="House - cloud - tree cycle with highlighted house."/>
            <div class="point">1</div>
            <h3>Tell us about your home</h3>
            <p>We calculate your carbon dioxide emission based on your utilities usage and location-specific information of how the energy
                is produced and transmitted.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="step">
            <img src="images/schema-cloud.png" alt="House - cloud - tree cycle with highlighted data cloud"/>
            <div class="point">2</div>
            <h3>Compare your options</h3>
            <p>Learn what contributes to your footprint. Compare options to reduce your emission and to offset what remains emitted. By
                reducing utilities usage, you'll also pay lower bills. Get to know how much you can save and what upfront costs you'll have
                to cover. Whenever possible, we complete our knowledge-based estimates with data-based estimates by analyzing previous
                implementations of a solution in other houses in the network, similar to yours.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="step">
            <img src="images/schema-tree.png" alt="House - cloud - tree cycle with highlighted tree"/>
            <div class="point">3</div>
            <h3>Take an action</h3>
            <p>Retrofit your house by addressing energy efficiency and shifting sources of energy to renewable, change your habits. Insulate
                your walls or renovate windows, install new solar panel, replace bulbs and plant trees to capture what you couldn't
                reduce.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="step">
            <img src="images/schema-arrows.png" alt="House - cloud - tree cycle with highlighted transition arrows"/>
            <div class="point">4</div>
            <h3>Repeat until you are neutral</h3>
            <p>Keep on measuring your utilities usage to see where you are. Keep on reducing your emission until you achieve
                carbon-neutrality and then maintain it by balancing emission with absorption. Start small, with replacing a few bulbs or
                setting thermostat one degree up/down. Over time as you build trust to our estimates you can make bigger improvements like
                renovating windows or installing solar panels, or even trying that new energy-efficiency technology which you've never
                considered before, but ultimately - make well informed decisions and move at your own pace. Track changes in your utilities
                usage and see effects, both ecological and economical, of your efforts.</p>

            <h3>Share with the community</h3>
            <p>Community is our super-power! Share changes you are making and how efficient they are so that we can make even more accurate
                estimates for others to rely on. We calculate efficiency of your implementation by computing what does 'normal' utility
                usage meant for your house before the change (relative to the baseline established by other similar and nearby houses) and
                after the change compare your new 'normal' with the old one.</p>
